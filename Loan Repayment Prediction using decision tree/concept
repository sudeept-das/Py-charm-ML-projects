Here we need to find out if my customers are going to return the loan they took from a bank or not

Problem Statement:
To predict if a customer will repay loan amount or not using decision tree algorithm in python

Solution:
balance_data.shape gives the number of rows and number of columns in the dataset

In the code X is our data and Y is our answer or target
In train_test_split random_state is used to randomly select data.

In DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion= "entropy", random_state= 100,
                                    max_depth=3, min_samples_leaf=5)
max_depth is the number of layers it will go before it stops
min_samples_leaf is the minimum number of leafs of the decision tree
