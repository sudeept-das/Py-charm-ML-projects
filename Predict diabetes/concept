Objective:
Predict whether a person will be diagnosed or not.
(We have a dataset of 762 people who were or were not diagnosed with diabetes)

Solution:
We will be looking at insulin.

We use train_test_split to split the data into training data and testing data.
We use StandardScalar preprocessing so that we do not have large bias or large numbers
We use KNeighborsClassifier to use KNN
We use confusion_matrix, f1_score and accuracy_score to testing the model

head() shows top 5 rows data
We will make a list of datas were value of Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, BMI and Insulin are not zero as if it is zero then the person wiil die.

Rule of Thumb: Any algorithm that computes distance or assumes normality, scale your features!
                That's why we need to do feature Scaling

In the code:
N_neighbors is 'K', p is the power parameter to define the metric used, which is 'Euclidean' in our case

It's important to evaluate the model, let's use confusion matrix to do that.
